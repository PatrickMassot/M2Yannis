    %A loop is a map defined on the circle $ùïä^1 = ‚Ñù/‚Ñ§$ with values in a
    %finite-dimensional vector space.
    %It can also freely be seen as $1$-periodic maps defined on $‚Ñù$.
  
    %The average of a loop $Œ≥$ is $\bar Œ≥ := \int_{ùïä^1} Œ≥(s)\, ds$.
  
    %The \emph{support} of a family $Œ≥$ of loops in $F$ parametrized by $E$ is
    %the closure of the set of $x$ in $E$ such that $Œ≥_x$ is not a constant loop.
